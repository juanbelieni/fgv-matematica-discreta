	abstract = {A graph \$G\$ has the Perfect-Matching-Hamiltonian property ({
	            PMH}-property) if for each one of its perfect matchings, there is
	            another perfect matching of \$G\$ such that the union of the two
	            perfect matchings yields a Hamiltonian cycle of \$G\$. The study
	            of graphs that have the {PMH}-property, initiated in the 1970s by
	            Las Vergnas and H{\textbackslash}"\{a\}ggkvist, combines three
	            well-studied properties of graphs, namely matchings,
	            Hamiltonicity and edge-colourings. In this work, we study these
	            concepts for cubic graphs in an attempt to characterise those
	            cubic graphs for which every perfect matching corresponds to one
	            of the colours of a proper 3-edge-colouring of the graph. We
	            discuss that this is equivalent to saying that such graphs are
	            even-2-factorable (E2F), that is, all 2-factors of the graph
	            contain only even cycles. The case for bipartite cubic graphs is
	            trivial, since if \$G\$ is bipartite then it is E2F. Thus, we
	            restrict our attention to non-bipartite cubic graphs. A
	            sufficient, but not necessary, condition for a cubic graph to be
	            E2F is that it has the {PMH}-property. The aim of this work is to
	            introduce an infinite family of E2F non-bipartite cubic graphs on
	            two parameters, which we coin papillon graphs, and determine the
	            values of the respective parameters for which these graphs have
	            the {PMH}-property or are just E2F. We also show that no two
	            papillon graphs with different parameters are isomorphic.},
