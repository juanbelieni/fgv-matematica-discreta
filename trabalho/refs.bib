	abstract = {A graph \$G\$ has the Perfect-Matching-Hamiltonian property (PMH-property) if for each one of its perfect matchings, there is another perfect matching of \$G\$ such that the union of the two perfect matchings yields a Hamiltonian cycle of \$G\$. The study of graphs that have the PMH-property, initiated in the 1970s by Las Vergnas and H{\textbackslash}"\{a\}ggkvist, combines three well-studied properties of graphs, namely matchings, Hamiltonicity and edge-colourings. In this work, we study these concepts for cubic graphs in an attempt to characterise those cubic graphs for which every perfect matching corresponds to one of the colours of a proper 3-edge-colouring of the graph. We discuss that this is equivalent to saying that such graphs are even-2-factorable (E2F), that is, all 2-factors of the graph contain only even cycles. The case for bipartite cubic graphs is trivial, since if \$G\$ is bipartite then it is E2F. Thus, we restrict our attention to non-bipartite cubic graphs. A sufficient, but not necessary, condition for a cubic graph to be E2F is that it has the PMH-property. The aim of this work is to introduce an infinite family of E2F non-bipartite cubic graphs on two parameters, which we coin papillon graphs, and determine the values of the respective parameters for which these graphs have the PMH-property or are just E2F. We also show that no two papillon graphs with different parameters are isomorphic.},

	abstract = {In paper Fink (2007) we proved Kreweras’ conjecture (Kreweras, 1996) asserting that every perfect matching of the n-dimensional hypercube can be extended into a Hamiltonian cycle. In this paper, we present two algorithms to find a Hamiltonian cycle extending a given perfect matching. The first algorithm computes the entire Hamiltonian cycle in time linear in the number of vertices answering a question raised by Knuth (2008) . The second algorithm outputs edges as they occur on the Hamiltonian cycle and the first k edges are found in time polynomial in both n and k.},
